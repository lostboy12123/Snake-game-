# Snake-game-
The Snake game is a game where the player controls a line that grows in length, with the line itself being the main obstacle. the player uses the arrow keys to move a "snake" around the board. As the snake finds food, it eats the food, and thereby grows larger. The game ends when the snake either moves off the screen or moves into itself.
